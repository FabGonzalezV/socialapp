# socialapp
fullstack app


This project pretends to create a simple social app to implement the skills of full-stack developers by using Webpack, react, MongoDB, node js, express, and Json-web-token . 

The web app implements a basic CRUD to update, create, delete, and list users by using MongoDB as a database, it also implements authentication with JWT and routes protected.

As the project progresses I will go into more detail.
